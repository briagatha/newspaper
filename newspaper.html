      		This movie was filmed in 1914, when the film was released in 1915, it shattered both box office and film-length records, running three hours and ten minutes. In 1998, it was voted #44 in the "Top 100 American films" by the American Film Institute. The movie was based off of Thomas Dixon Jr.'s novels, such as The Clansman and The Leopard's spots. 
			But the film was charged for racism and protests by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). And because most of the actors where white, the film was banned by few review boards. The Birth of a Nation had been credited as groundbreaking for its innovative application of the medium of film.

			According to the film historian Kevin Brownlow, he states that the film was "Astounding in its time" and that "so many advances in filmmaking technique that it was rendered obsolete within a few years." The work has received widespread criticism for it blatantly racist, of scenes that are presented onscreen as a documentary.
			Film Critic Roger Elbert writes, "Certainly The Birth of a Nation presents a challenge for Modern Audiences." People who are uninterested in film history or don't understand silent movies, they probably won't be interested in this film. But it definitely is an important part of history.
