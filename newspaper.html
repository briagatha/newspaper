      <p>Utah may be ranked no. 20 in the latest AP poll, but there are a couple of areas where the Utes rank No. 1 in collage football's metrics. one of them: They are the best in the country at...special teams. Stop. Don't bail for that other story guessing who the starting Quarter back wil be. this third-phrase thing is a lot more important than you think.</p>

      <p>Not only are Utah's special teams ranked first this season, according to analytics concocted by ESPN, they are the best college special teams since the 2004 Miami hurricanes. In that formula, ESPN evaluates all special teams, including context or their performances, such as down and distance, yards from the end zone, time on the clock, and it totals contributing points. Ute special teams are adding 7.8 points a game to their scoring margin.</p>
